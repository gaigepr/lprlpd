This file contains a discussion of the lpr command line flags as described in `man lpr`.
In particular, this document will be the place to decide which flags will not be supported.
Phil Nelson suggested there are many flags that are unneeded because they are for very old hardware.

# Unsure of the importance of this. Does the existing code do this?
-c : The files are assumed to contain data produced by cifplot

# Definitely important. This is still a standard.
-d : The files are assumed to contain data from tex (DVI format from stanford)

# Unsure, refer to existing code.
-f : Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as a standard FORTRAN carriages control character.

# Unsure, refer to exisiting code.
-g : The files are assumed to containt standard plot data as produced by the plot routines.
     (see also plot for the filters used by the printer spooler)

# Probably important.
-l : Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and suppress page breaks.

# Probably important because troff is for man pages.
-n : The file are assumed to contain data from ditroff (device independent troff).

# Very important. Very common for printers to want things in a postscript format.
-o : The files are assumed to be in postscript format.

# Probably important.
-p : Use pr(1) to fornat the files (equivalent to print).

# Very important, man pages are written with troff.
-t : The files are assumed to contain data from troff(1) (cat phototypesetter commands).

# The Benson Varian seems to be a very old device. We can probably ignore this option.
-v : The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like the Benson Varian.

These options apply to the handling of the print job:

# Important.
-h : Suppress the printing of the burst page.

# Important.
-m : Send mail upon complettion.

# Important. Override default printer, should any use be able to do this?
-p : Force output to a specific printer.
     Normally, the default printer is used or the value of the environment variable PRINTER.

# Important.
-q : Queue the print job but do not start the spooling daemom.

# Important.
-r : Remove the file ipon completion of spooling or upon completion of printing (with -s option).

# Important
-s : Use symlinks. Usually files are copied to the spool directory.
     The -s option will use symlink(2) to link data files rather than trying to copy them; large files can be printed.
     This means the files should not be modified until they have been printed.

Normally lpr works silently except for diagnostic messages. This option changes that.

# Important.
-R : Writes a message to stdout containing the unique number which is used to identify this job.
     This number can be used to cancel (see lprm(1)) or find the status (see lpq(1)) of the job.

The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers.

# Important
-#num : The quantity num is the number of copies desired of each file.
        e.g.: lpr -#3 foo.c # Would print 3 copies of foo.c

# Important?
-[1234] font : Specifies a font to be mounted on font position i.
               The daemon will construct a .railmag file referencing the font pathname.

# Important
-C class : Job classification to use on the burst page.

# Important.
-i -numcols : the output is indented by numcols.

# Important.
-J job : Job name to print on the burst page. Normally the file's name is used.

# Important
-T title : Title name for pr(1), instead of file name.

# Important.
-U user : user name to print on the burst page, also for accounting purposes.
          This option is only honored if the real user-id is daemon
          (or that specified in the printcap file instead of daemon),
          and is intended for those instances where print filters wish to requeue jobs.

# Important.
-wnum : uses num as the page width for pr(1).
